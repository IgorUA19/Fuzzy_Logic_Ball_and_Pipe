# Fuzzy_Logic_Ball_and_Pipe

Overview of Project 
This project starts with a physical ball and pipe system that is made up of a vertical cylinder with a ping pong ball controlled by a fan at the bottom with height 
measured by a time of flight sensor at the top. Our project objective is to balance the ball at a target altitude by using a controller of our groups choice. Our group decided on the Fuzzy Logic Controller, or the FLC. We have to correctly implement the FLC into the MATLAB codes to open serial communication with a ball and pipe system.
