# Fuzzy_Logic_Ball_and_Pipe

Overview of Project 
This project starts with a physical ball and pipe system that is made up of a vertical cylinder with a ping pong ball controlled by a fan at the bottom with height measured by a time of flight sensor at the top. Our project objective is to balance the ball at a target altitude by using a controller of our groups choice. Our group decided on the Fuzzy Logic Controller, or the FLC. We have to correctly implement the FLC into the MATLAB codes to open serial communication with a ball and pipe system. 


Theory of Control Method 
The Fuzzy Logic Controller, FLC, is a control system that runs off the mathematical system known as "Fuzzy Logic". Fuzzy Logic is logic that can handle the concept of partial truth or "partially true". It accomplishes this by having the truth value of variables to be any real number between 0 and 1 and using a Human Based set of rules created by the designer to weigh out the "partial truths" and make a decision based on the rules. In a system the Fuzzy Logic Controller, FLC would take an input called a "crisp input" this would be
